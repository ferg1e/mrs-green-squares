# Mrs. Green Squares

Mrs. Green Squares visualizes the commits in local Git repositories.
The layout is almost identical to the GitHub commits visualization, but this tool also shows commit messages and you can group repos into different colors.
The output format is an HTML file.

## Install & Run

- `git clone https://github.com/ferg1e/mrs-green-squares.git git-vis`
- `cd git-vis`
- `npm install`
- edit the `repos` value in `src/config.json` to point to a directory that has a Git repo
- `node src/index.js`
- your commits visualization will now be in `git-vis/index.html`

## Config

Config section coming soon.
